# Notes App

This project is a full stack notes application built with a clear separation between the frontend and backend. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is organized in its own folder for maintainability. The app allows users to create, view, and manage notes efficiently. Work is currently in progress, and new features and improvements are being added regularly.
